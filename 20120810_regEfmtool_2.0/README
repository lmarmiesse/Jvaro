README - regEfmtool version 2.0
===============================

Copyright 2012 Christian Jungreuthmayer

This README covers the following sections:
1. INSTALLATION
2. COMPILATION
3. HOW TO RUN THE PROVIDED TEST CASES
4. MISCELLANEOUS

regEfmtool is written in Java and, hence, a multi-platform program (Linux, MacOS X, Windows,...).
This README only covers installation, compilation and operation under Linux.
We tested regEfmtool on Ubuntu Linux 11.04 and MacOS X 10.7.
However, installation and usage of regEfmtool on other platforms is supposed to be easy.

regEfmtool is an extension ofo the original efmtool by Marco Terzer (http://www.csb.ethz.ch/tools/efmtool/).

Important:
The implementation of regEfmtool is only a proof of concept.
We tried to implement the filtering of modes as non-invasive as possible.
Hence, parts of the new code disobey the standard best practice guidelines,
but might assist a potential programmer in incorporating her/his own new ideas.
Additionally, a more thorough implementation will definitely result in a performance gain.
Of course, the results obtained by this version of the regEfmtool were double-checked
for plausibility and correctness. We are not aware of any bugs or that the extension to the original efmtool
produces incorrect results. But as any humble programmer we are sure regEfmtool contains bugs.
If you find bugs please report them to christian.jungreuthmayer@acib.at


1. INSTALLATION
===============

regEfmtool is published as a zipped tar-file.
First, download the zipped tar-file which is typically called something like 20120716_regEfmtool_2.0.tar.gz.
In order to install the regEfmtool just create a proper directory,
e.g. /opt/regEfmtool. Change to the newly created directory by using 'cd /opt/regEfmtool'.
The installation is simply done by untaring the zipped archive file, e.g. by executing
tar -xvzf /tmp/20120716_regEfmtool_2.0.tar.gz

2. COMPILATION
==============

The published archive file of the regEfmfile comes with a pre-compiled version.
This pre-compilation was done using JDK-1.7.0. Compilation of regEfmtool can be done
using the provided Makefile which can be found in the archive's root directory,
e.g. /opt/regEfmtool/20120716_regEfmtool_2.0/Makefile. Open the Makefile with your favorite editor
and adapt the two variables (JAR and JAVAC) according to your system installation.
Save the changes and simply execute:
make
make jarfile

Note:
a) The 'make jarfile' overwrites the pre-compilied version of the regEfmtool.
b) We only tested regEfmtool with JDK-1.7.0.
c) regEfmtool does not work with Java version less than JDK-1.7.
d) Other java versions have not been used by us, yet.
e) We did not develop, use and test regEfmtool with Eclipse or any other IDE.

In order to delete all compiled class files execute:
make clean

3. HOW TO RUN THE PROVIDED TEST CASES
=====================================

The published package also comes with some test cases which can be found in the
folder 'examples', e.g. /opt/regEfmtool/20120716_regEfmtool_2.0/examples. These test cases
can simply be run by executing the provided start scripts, e.g. start_regEfmtool_simple_1:
cd /opt/regEfmtool/20120716_regEfmtool_2.0/examples
./start_regEfmtool_simple_1

If you experience problems make sure that the program 'java' is installed on your system
and that the PATH variable is set accordingly.

4. MISCELLANEOUS
================

Further information can be found in the file README_GENERULE,
which contains details about the syntax of the gene rule file.
