/**
 * The <tt>Fractional2PatternTreeRankUpdateAdjacencyEnumerator</tt> uses pattern trees for
 * candidate narrowing, and rank computation for adjacency testing. The ranks 
 * are not always computed from scratch, but updated. For every node pair, the
 * rank matrix is processed when it is used the first time. Child node pairs can
 * then base their rank computation on parent pairs, i.e. the gauss algorithm 
 * starts where the parent rank computation stopped (it stopped because no other
 * non-zero pivot was found). Note that child node-pairs have fewer zeros in the
 * zero sets, and thus the sub matrix of the stoichiometric matrix contains more
 * columns, but at least those columns from the parent node pair.
 * <p>
 * Compared to {@link FractionalPatternTreeRankUpdateAdjacencyEnumerator}, 
 * this version copies the leaf matrices. For every rank computation, the copy
 * is restored. Avoiding thousands of operations with the same matrix, the 
 * fraction numbers can be kept smaller
